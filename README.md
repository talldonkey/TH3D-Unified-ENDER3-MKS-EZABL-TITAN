**TH3D Unified Firmware with changes for my Custom Ender-3 with MKS-GEN-L and EZABL**

----------

This fork is meant for my Creality Ender-3 Modded machine with these properties/mods

* Early Ender-3, Offset wheels, single sided Y tensioner, glued on build sheet
* Stock Display
* MKS Gen L Mainboard
* FYSETC TMC2208 V1.2 on X, Y, Z in Standalone
* MKS LV8729 on E
* Stock Creality Hotend with [TH3D Titanium All-Metal Heatbreak](https://www.th3dstudio.com/product/tough-titanium-heatbreak-for-creality-machines-tough-dual-hotend/)
* [Petsfang Direct with Titan Extruder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2907538)
* [TH3D EZABL Mini](https://www.th3dstudio.com/product-category/auto-bed-leveling/) using the left-side mounted EZABL mount provided by the Petsfang Direct
  * This assumes that the EZABL was purchased from TH3D and that the Z-End-Stop has been modified for the EZABL.
* [TH3D EZOut V1](https://www.th3dstudio.com/product/ezout-cr-10-filament-sensor-kit/)  (not implemented/tested!)

**This firmware is NOT maintained by TH3D. This is meant to be a personal fork/branch that will never be merged back to TH3D Unified Firmware, but rather provides me the ability to make my own custom changes while merging in upstream TH3D firmware updates that support future TH3D products**
